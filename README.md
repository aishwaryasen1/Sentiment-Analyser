# Sentiment-Analyser
Sentiment Analysis is an important application of Natural Language Processing which utilizes contextual text mining to extract the sentiment from a piece of text. In this project the popular movie review dataset - "IMDB Dataset" has been used to develop a human sentiment analyzer, which given any input statement returns the emotion contained in it i.e. positive or negative. The tokenizer used is 'RegexpTokenizer' and stemmer is 'PorterStemmer'. The classification technique leveraged here is 'Multinomial Naive Bayes'. The model was then deployed using Flask to create an interactive website.
